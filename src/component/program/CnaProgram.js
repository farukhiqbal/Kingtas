While the baccalaureate graduate must be adept at performing skills, major roles will also include teaching, delegating, and supervising the performance of skilled tasks by others. Consequently, graduates must approach their understanding and use of skills in a sophisticated theoretical and analytic manner. The acquisition of new skills is an ongoing competent of the nursing career. Skills development should focus on the mastery of core scientific principles that underline all skills, thus preparing the graduate to incorporate current and future technical skills into other nursing responsibilities, and apply skills in diverse contexts of health care delivery.
